## âœ¨ Key Features

### Drawing & Tools

* **Pixel-Perfect Pen**: A core drawing tool that creates clean, single-pixel lines without unwanted anti-aliasing.
* **Color Palette**: A full-featured palette with default swatches, a primary/secondary color system, and a color picker. Right-click on the canvas to quickly swap primary and secondary colors!
* **Shape Tools**: Draw perfect Lines, Rectangles, and Ellipses with a live preview.
* **Advanced Brushes**: Use the **Curve Brush** to create and adjust smooth, vector-like curves or the **Smooth Brush** for fluid, freehand strokes.
* **Fill Tool (Bucket)**: Fill areas with color, with adjustable tolerance and the ability to reference all visible layers for accurate fills.
* **Symmetry Tools (Mirroring)**: Draw with various symmetry modes (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and more) to create intricate designs effortlessly. Animated guides show you the axes of symmetry.
* **Eraser**: A standard eraser tool to remove parts of your drawing.

### Animation & Timeline

* **Frame-by-Frame Timeline**: Manage your animation sequence at the bottom of the screen. You can add, duplicate, delete, and reorder frames with ease.
* **Live Preview**: See your animation play in real-time in the preview panel.
* **Onion Skinning**: Toggle on to see transparent versions of the previous and next frames, helping you create smooth motion.
* **Adjustable FPS**: Control the playback speed of your animation by setting the Frames Per Second (FPS).
* **Looping**: Set your animation to loop continuously in the preview window.

### Layers

* **Full Layer System**: Work non-destructively with a complete layer stack. You can add, delete, and reorder layers.
* **Layer Properties**: Each layer has its own visibility, opacity, and blend mode (e.g., Multiply, Screen, Overlay) for advanced compositing effects.
* **Layer Naming**: Double-click a layer's name to rename it for better organization.

### Selection & Manipulation

* **Selection Tools**: Make precise selections using the **Rectangle** or free-form **Lasso** tools.
* **Transform Selection**: Once an area is selected, you can move, rotate, cut, copy, and paste it.
* **Frame Clipboard**: Copy and paste the entire contents of a frame.

### Usability & Workflow

* **Undo/Redo**: A robust undo/redo system lets you step backward and forward through nearly every action.
* **Customizable Themes**: Change the entire look and feel of the application by choosing from a wide variety of built-in color themes.
* **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Speed up your workflow with common shortcuts like `Ctrl+Z` (Undo), `Ctrl+Y` (Redo), `Ctrl+C` (Copy), and more.
* **Panning & Zooming**: Navigate the canvas by holding the middle mouse button to pan or using `Ctrl + Mouse Wheel` to zoom in and out.

### Input Methods

* **Mouse and Keyboard**: Full support for traditional desktop input.
* **Touch Support**: The application is touch-friendly. Use one finger to draw, or two fingers to **pinch-to-zoom** and **pan** the canvas.
* **Stylus Pressure**: If you have a drawing tablet or stylus, you can enable pressure sensitivity for dynamic brush sizes.

### Project Management

* **Save/Load Projects**: Save your entire projectâ€”including all frames, layers, and settingsâ€”into a single `.json` file that you can open later to continue your work.
* **Export Animations**: Export your finished animation as an animated **GIF** or a **WebM** video file, ready to be shared online.
* **Export Single Frame**: Save the current frame as a static PNG image.
