- Add programmable animating, so you will be able to write a script in the app to add frames, draw an image at a position, line,
    object etc, all assigned to the frame or frames you wish, use mathematical equations to move the drawing to another position    
    on the canvas. This will allow people to be more specific with out having something to draw with. It will read the script 
    and produce it to the animation studio as an animation.
